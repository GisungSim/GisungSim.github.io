Welcome to my personal website! I am currently working at the Atomic and Quantum Optics Laboratory at Pusan National University, South Korea.

My research interests include:
- Fundamental Physics with Tabletop Experiments
- Precision Measurement
- Quantum Metrology and Sensing
- Light-Matter Interactions
- Cavity QED
- Quantum Simulation and Many-Body Physics
- and _their applications_

But the list of my interest is even longer. I am open to exploring other fascinating research areas and ideas!


My vision encompasses both the pursuit of fundamental physics beyond the Standard Model and the development of future technologies that can improve people's lives in various fields.

In line with this vision, my key experiment has involved generating squeezed states of light. Starting from scratch, I putted hard efforts to this goal. After many trials, I have recently succeeded! [more detail](/research-experiment/)

This achievement is now leading to various exciting research subjects:
- Quantum-enhanced electric field sensing with a Rydberg atom
- Quantum-enhanced optical magnetometry
- Quantum information with continuous variables
