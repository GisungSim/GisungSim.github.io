Welcome to my personal website! I am currently working at the Atomic and Quantum Optics Laboratory at Pusan National University, South Korea.

My research interests are:
- Fundamental Physics with Tabletop Experiments
- Precision Measurement
- Quantum Metrology
- Cavity QED
- Quantum Simulation and Many-Body Physics
- and _Their applications_

But the list of my interest is even longer. I am open to other interesting research areas!

My vision is achieving both pursuing fundamental physics beyond the Standard Model and developing future technologies that will improve people's lives.

Along with my vision, my key experiment has been about generating squeezed states of light. Started from scratch, I tried really hard to achieve it. After many trials and errors, I recently achieved it! [more detail](/research-experiment/)

This achievement is now leading to various exciting research subjects:
- Quantum-enhanced electric field sensing using Rydberg atom
- Quantum-enhanced optical magnetometry
- Quantum information with continuous variables
