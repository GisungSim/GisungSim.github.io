<p style="font-size: 30px;"><b>Welcome to my personal website!</b></p>
<p align="justify">I am currently working at the Quantum Sensors Research Center at Pusan National University, South Korea.</p>

<p style="font-size: 24px;"><b>What is my purpose in life?</b></p>
<p align="justify">After deep contemplation, I have come to the conclusion that striving to understand the nature in which I exist holds the greatest meaning for me. Additionally, if I can contribute to expanding the scope of human consciousness and bettering our world in the process, that would be incredibly fulfilling.</p>

<p align="justify">This prospect excites me and gives me a strong reason to wake up every morning with enthusiasm. I want to live for this purpose, and I believe that the role of a physicist is ideally suited for achieving these goals.</p>

<p align="justify">In my pursuit, I find experimental physics to be the most direct way to engage with nature and seek answers. And, as I previously stated, my deep fascination lies in tabletop experiments. However, I am also enthusiastic about studying and embracing theoretical approaches to enrich my understanding of physics further.</p>

<p style="font-size: 24px;"><b>My long-term academic goals</b></p>
<p align="justify">-Exploring New Physics Beyond the Standard Model: Direct experiments on the quantum nature of gravity, dark matter and dark energy, and new physics beyond the Standard Model.</p>
<p align="justify">-Studying Light-Matter Interactions: Investigate strong interactions between matter and light, quantum simulation, and quantum many-body physics.</p>
<p align="justify">-Paving the Way for Future Technologies: Develop advanced quantum sensors, quantum imaging techniques, and quantum information processing.</p>
