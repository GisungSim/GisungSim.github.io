Welcome to my personal website! I am currently working at the Atomic and Quantum Optics Laboratory at Pusan National University, South Korea.

My research interests are:
- Fundamental Physics with Tabletop Experiments
- Precision Measurement
- Quantum Metrology
- Cavity QED
- Quantum Simulation and Many-Body Physics
- and _Their applications_

But the list of my interest is even longer. I am open to other interesting research areas!

My vision is achieving both pursuing fundamental physics beyond the Standard Model and developing future technologies that will improve people's lives.

Along with my vision, my key experiment has been about generating squeezed states of light. Started from scratch, I tried really hard to achieve it. After many trials and errors, I recently achieved it! [_more detail_](/research-experiment/)

In this exciting journey, I've not only accomplished the generation of two-mode squeezed light from rubidium vapor—a first in Korea using atomic vapor—but have also pushed the boundaries of quantum-enhanced electrometry and magnetometry. My efforts in overcoming numerous technical challenges, such as noise reduction and stabilizing laser frequencies, have been instrumental in these breakthroughs.

My current focus is on harnessing these squeezed states for quantum metrology, exploring their potential in precision measurements that surpass the standard quantum limit. I am also deeply fascinated by the prospect of utilizing other quantum states, like Schrödinger-cat states, for enhanced sensitivity in electrometry, inspired by groundbreaking works in the field.

Moreover, my interest in atom interferometry and atomic clocks is not just academic. I am actively engaged in experiments that leverage these tools for probing the mysteries of quantum gravity and searching for new physics beyond the Standard Model. Recent advances in matter-wave interferometry and time-keeping precision have opened new horizons, and I am eager to contribute to these evolving domains.

The synergy between quantum many-body physics and precision measurements is another area of my focus. I am exploring how quantum simulators can be integrated with atomic clocks to advance fundamental research, with a particular interest in novel entangled states.

As I look towards the future, I am committed to expanding my knowledge in electronics and mathematics, recognizing their crucial role in experimental physics. My journey in learning group theory, Lie algebra, and other advanced mathematical concepts is driven by my quest to deepen my physical intuition and enhance my research capabilities.

Ultimately, my goal is to unravel the mysteries of the universe and contribute to the advancement of human knowledge and technology. Whether as a professor or a researcher, I am dedicated to pursuing this path with passion and perseverance, blending experimental and theoretical approaches to achieve my objectives.
