<p style="font-size: 30px;"><b>Beyond the Standard Quantum Limit: The Generation of Squeezed States</b></p>

<p style="font-size: 24px;"><b>The Generation of a Squeezed State from Four-Wave Mixing</b></p>

With hard effort and many trials, I have successfully generated a two-mode squeezed state of light via four-wave mixing with a diode laser!

In this experiment, I achieved over 7.9 dB of intensity-difference squeezing. To the best of our knowledge, this is the best record of squeezing in a similar system, as well as the first squeezed state using atomic vapor in South Korea!
