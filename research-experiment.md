<p style="font-size: 24px;">The Generation of Squeezed States from Four-Wave Mixing</p>

With hard effort and trials, I have successfully generated a two-mode squeezed state of light via four-wave mixing!
This was in fact the first accomplishment using atomic vapor in Korea, and the second achievement overall in Korea! (The first overall was at KAIST, but with using spontaneous parametric down-conversion.)

I measured around 6 dB of intensity-difference squeezing, indicating that the noise power is suppressed by 75% beyond the standard quantum limit (a limit on measurement accuracy at quantum scales; or the maximum measurement accuracy achievable with classical states). In our experimental setup, the highest degree of squeezing occurred at 100 kHz, and the squeezing bandwidth's upper limit reached up to 2 MHz.

In this experiment, I utilized the double-lambda system of the D1 transition of <sup>85</sup>Rb. This scheme allows us to circumvent fundamental limitations to efficient squeezing, such as spontaneous emission [C. F. McCormick _et al_. PRA 78, 043816 (2008)].
