<p style="font-size: 24px;">The Generation of Squeezed States</p>

With hard effort and trials and errors, I have successfully generated a two-mode squeezed state of light from four-wave mixing!

I measured around 6 dB of intensity-difference squeezing, which means the noise power is suppressed by 75% beyond the standard quantum limit. In our experimental setup, the degree of squeezing has been the maximum at 100 kHz. And the upper limit of the squeezing bandwidth is up to 2 MHz.

In this experiment, I used the double-lambda system of the D1 transition of <sup>85</sup>Rb. Using this scheme, we can circumvent fundamental limitations for efficient squeezing such as spontaneous emission [C. F. McCormick _et al_, PRA 78, 043816 (2008)].

<p style="font-size: 24px;">Overcoming Challenges</p>

The path to this discovery was not straightforward. My lab had never before conducted research on squeezed states, especially using atomic vapor. I encountered numerous challenges â€“ from overwhelming noise in the lab that initially made experiments seem impossible, to issues with laser power, equipment malfunctions, and even fluctuations in the four-wave mixing signal. Each obstacle was a lesson in persistence and innovation. Through rigorous testing, assumption analysis, and problem-solving, I was able to overcome these hurdles.

<p style="font-size: 24px;">The Thrill of Discovery</p>

The moment we first detected the squeezing signal was a landmark in my career. It was a testament to the power of perseverance and the thrill of pushing the boundaries of quantum physics.

<p style="font-size: 24px;">Looking Ahead</p>

This achievement is not just a personal milestone but a stepping stone to further explorations in quantum-enhanced electrometry, magnetometry, and quantum information with continuous variables.

The journey in quantum optics is not just about overcoming technical challenges; it's about venturing into the unknown and unlocking new possibilities for future technologies. As I continue my research, I am driven by the promise of discovery and the potential to contribute to the prosperity of humanity through quantum technology.
