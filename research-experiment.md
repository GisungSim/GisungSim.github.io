**Exploring the Quantum Frontier: The Generation of Squeezed States**

My Journey into Quantum Optics

My fascination with quantum sensing at Pusan National University's Atomic and Quantum Optics Laboratory led me to a groundbreaking area of research: the generation of squeezed light. This journey, while filled with challenges, has been one of the most exhilarating experiences of my academic career.

What are Squeezed States?

Squeezed states of light are a remarkable phenomenon in quantum optics. In simple terms, they represent a form of light where certain properties are reduced or 'squeezed' below the standard quantum limit, while others are expanded. This is akin to squeezing one side of a balloon – the air moves and expands the other side. In the quantum world, this manipulation allows us to measure certain physical properties with precision that surpasses traditional limits.

The Process of Generating Squeezed States

In my research, I focused on generating two-mode squeezed light from rubidium vapor – a first using atomic vapor in Korea. The process begins with preparing rubidium atoms in a specific quantum state. We then use precisely controlled lasers to interact with these atoms. During this interaction, the properties of the light (like phase and amplitude) undergo quantum fluctuations, and through careful manipulation, we squeeze these fluctuations in one property while expanding them in the other. This results in a light source with unique quantum properties, ideal for high-precision measurements.

Overcoming Challenges

The path to this discovery was not straightforward. My lab had never before conducted research on squeezed states, especially using atomic vapor. I encountered numerous challenges – from overwhelming noise in the lab that initially made experiments seem impossible, to issues with laser power, equipment malfunctions, and even fluctuations in the four-wave mixing signal. Each obstacle was a lesson in persistence and innovation. Through rigorous testing, assumption analysis, and problem-solving, I was able to overcome these hurdles.

The Thrill of Discovery

The moment we first detected the squeezing signal was a landmark in my career. It was a testament to the power of perseverance and the thrill of pushing the boundaries of quantum physics.

Looking Ahead

This achievement is not just a personal milestone but a stepping stone to further explorations in quantum-enhanced electrometry, magnetometry, and quantum information with continuous variables.

The journey in quantum optics is not just about overcoming technical challenges; it's about venturing into the unknown and unlocking new possibilities for future technologies. As I continue my research, I am driven by the promise of discovery and the potential to contribute to the prosperity of humanity through quantum technology.
