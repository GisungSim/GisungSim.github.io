<p style="font-size: 24px;">The Generation of Squeezed States from Four-Wave Mixing</p>

With hard effort and trials, I have successfully generated a two-mode squeezed state of light via four-wave mixing!

I measured around 6 dB of intensity-difference squeezing, indicating that the noise power is suppressed by 75% beyond the standard quantum limit (a limit on measurement accuracy at quantum scales; or the maximum measurement accuracy achievable with classical states). In our experimental setup, the highest degree of squeezing occurred at 100 kHz, and the squeezing bandwidth's upper limit reached up to 2 MHz.

In this experiment, I utilized the double-lambda system of the D1 transition of <sup>85</sup>Rb. This scheme allows us to circumvent fundamental limitations to efficient squeezing, such as spontaneous emission [C. F. McCormick _et al_. PRA 78, 043816 (2008)].

<p style="font-size: 24px;">Overcoming Challenges</p>

The path to this discovery was not straightforward. My lab had never before conducted research on squeezed states, especially using atomic vapor. I encountered numerous challenges â€“ from overwhelming noise in the lab that initially made experiments seem impossible, to issues with laser power, equipment malfunctions, and even fluctuations in the four-wave mixing signal. Each obstacle was a lesson in persistence and innovation. Through rigorous testing, assumption analysis, and problem-solving, I was able to overcome these hurdles.

<p style="font-size: 24px;">The Thrill of Discovery</p>

The moment we first detected the squeezing signal was a landmark in my career. It was a testament to the power of perseverance and the thrill of pushing the boundaries of quantum physics.


<p style="font-size: 24px;">Why Four-Wave Mixing?</p>

The most general way to generate squeezed states of light is using spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC). Generally, you can achieve very large amounts of quantum noise reduction beyond the standard quantum limit. However,

This achievement is not just a personal milestone but a stepping stone to further explorations in quantum-enhanced electrometry, magnetometry, and quantum information with continuous variables.

The journey in quantum optics is not just about overcoming technical challenges; it's about venturing into the unknown and unlocking new possibilities for future technologies. As I continue my research, I am driven by the promise of discovery and the potential to contribute to the prosperity of humanity through quantum technology.
