**My Mother: A Pillar of Strength and Resilience**

My mother is not just a parent to me; she is the epitome of resilience and determination. Born into challenging circumstances as a Joseonjok in China, her life was a journey marked by hardship and perseverance. Her grandparents, seeking escape from poverty under Japanese colonial rule, fled to China. But the poverty followed them.

Despite these adversities, however, my mother's spirit remained unbroken.

She, alongside her mother and sister, moved to Korea, driven by the hope of a better lifeâ€”the 'Korean Dream'. But the dream was not without its trials. With limited education, having only completed junior high, she faced jobs that were often undervalued and underpaid. These included working at a factory's assembly line and serving as a dishwasher and waitress. Yet, she never let these experiences define her or dampen her spirit.

Her resilience is something that deeply inspires me. In a society where Joseonjok people often face discrimination and prejudice, she stood tall and unyielding. Despite speaking with a heavy accent, she worked tirelessly, transcending barriers, to become a licensed hairdresser and eventually the proud owner of her own hair salon. Her journey is a testament to the power of hard-working and the belief in oneself.

Her clients adore her, not just for her skills, but for the warmth and acceptance she radiates. This acceptance is something she's instilled in me as well. She taught me the importance of embracing our identities, no matter how different they may be perceived by society. She showed me that often, discrimination stems from ignorance and that understanding and exposure can bridge divides.

My mother's story is not just a narrative of overcoming odds; it's a lesson in compassion, tenacity, and the unwavering pursuit of one's dreams. She is a living example that challenges, no matter how daunting, can be overcome with perseverance and a positive outlook.

She's my greatest inspiration, a beacon of hope, and a reminder that our circumstances do not define us, but our actions and choices do. Her life is a beautiful illustration of how embracing our uniqueness and working hard can lead to a life of fulfillment and success.
