My Mother: A Pillar of Strength and Resilience

My mother is a remarkable woman whose journey has been marked by resilience, hard work, and an unwavering spirit. Born into a Joseonjok family, ethnic Koreans from China, she experienced hardships from a young age. Her family, seeking a better life, moved to Korea, carrying with them the hopes of escaping poverty. However, the challenges followed, and with limited education, my mother's options were constrained to menial jobs.

Despite these hurdles, my mother never succumbed to despair. She embodied the true essence of determination, working tirelessly to change her circumstances. Her journey from washing dishes and waiting tables to becoming a licensed hairdresser and eventually owning her own salon is not just a story of success; it's a testament to her indomitable spirit.

Growing up, I watched my mother face discrimination and prejudice with grace and strength. She never allowed societal stereotypes to define her or diminish her worth. Her clients, charmed by her skill and warm personality, came to love and accept her, regardless of her accent or background. This acceptance was a powerful lesson for me, showing that often, discrimination stems from ignorance and that exposure and understanding can bridge divides.

My mother's story is one of transformation and triumph. Her journey has taught me invaluable lessons about the power of hard work, the importance of designing one's own life, and coping with adversity. She is not just a mother; she is a beacon of hope, showing that with perseverance and a strong will, one can overcome even the toughest of obstacles.

I owe my values and my strength to my mother. Her example has instilled in me a deep respect for diversity and an unwavering commitment to standing up for those who are marginalized. She is more than a parent; she is my inspiration, a guiding light in my life's journey.
